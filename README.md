Module 4 Homework Assignment - Pandas Challenge

## District Summary
For this challenge we were tasked wtih performing the necessary calculations to create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame. 

The DataFrame should include: 
* Total number of unique schools
* Total number of students
* Total budget
* Average math and reading scores
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The percentage of students who passed both math and reading

## School Summary
For this challenge we were tasked wtih performing the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each shool.

The DataFrame should include: 
* School name and type
* Total number of students
* Total school budget
* Budget per student
* Average math and reading scores
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The percentage of students who passed both math and reading

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
For this challenge we were tasked with creating a DataFram called "top_schools". This DataFrame should sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
For this challenge we were tasked with creating a DataFram called "bottom_schools". This DataFrame should sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

## Math Scores by Grade
For this challenge we were tasked with performing the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level at each school. 

## Reading Scores by Grade
For this challenge we were tasked with creating a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level at each school.

## Scores by School Spending
For this challenge we were tasked with creating a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student. 

We were provided a code that would create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. We were also provided a code to calculate mean scores per spending range. 

Using the scores that we calculated, we were to create a DataFrame called spending_summary which would iclude the following metrics:
* Average math and reading score
* The percentage of students who passed math
* The percentage of students who passed reading
* The percentage of students who passed both math and reading

## Scores by School Size
For this challenge we were tasked with creating a DataFram called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size. 

## Scores by Shool Type
For this challenge we were to use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary. This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the school type.
